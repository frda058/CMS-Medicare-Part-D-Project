# CMS-Medicare-Provider-Specialty-ML-Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a multi-class classification model that can predict physician specialties using the Medicare prescription drug data. The file can be dowloaded from https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-part-d-prescribers/medicare-part-d-prescribers-by-provider-and-drug. The main goal of this project is to distinguish physician specialties based on their prescribing habits in order to identify potential fraudulent behavior.
